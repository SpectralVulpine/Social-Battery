# SocialBattery

## What happens when introverts and extraverts collide?

Now you can find out! __SocialBattery__ gives every player a "battery" to keep an eye on. This battery charges or discharges depending on the player's assigned personality and the distance he or she is from other players. Be careful - if the battery reaches zero, you'll die!

### Usage

__/sobat recharge <player>__
Recharges the given player's battery to 100%.

__/sobat reload__
Reloads the configuration file.

__/sobat reset__
Resets the configuration file to its default values.

__/sobat swap <player__
Swaps the given player's personality from extravert to introvert or vice versa.
